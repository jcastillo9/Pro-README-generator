# User Story
As a developer, I want a README generator so that I can quickly create a professional README for a new project.

# How it Works

* GIVEN a command-line application that accepts user input
* WHEN I am prompted for information about my application repository
* THEN a high-quality, professional README.md is generated with the title of my project and sections entitled Description, Table of Contents, Installation, Usage, License, Contributing, Tests, and Questions
* WHEN I enter my project title
* THEN this is displayed as the title of the README
* WHEN I enter a description, installation instructions, usage information, contribution guidelines, and test instructions
* THEN this information is added to the sections of the README entitled Description, Installation, Usage, Contributing, and Tests
* WHEN I choose a license for my application from a list of options
* THEN a badge for that license is added near the top of the README and a notice is added to the section of the README entitled License that explains which license the application is covered under
* WHEN I enter my GitHub username
* THEN this is added to the section of the README entitled Questions, with a link to my GitHub profile
* WHEN I enter my email address
* THEN this is added to the section of the README entitled Questions, with instructions on how to reach me with additional questions
* WHEN I click on the links in the Table of Contents
* THEN I am taken to the corresponding section of the README
